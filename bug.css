The CSS property `clip-path` can sometimes produce unexpected results due to browser inconsistencies in handling complex shapes or very precise coordinates.  For example, a slightly incorrect coordinate can render the element completely invisible. Another common issue is using a clip-path with an element that also has a border or box-shadow; the clipping path might not interact as expected with these elements leading to unexpected visual outcomes.  Furthermore,  performance can be significantly impacted with complex `clip-path` shapes, especially on low-powered devices, leading to janky animations or rendering.
